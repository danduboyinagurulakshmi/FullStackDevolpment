1\. Water Consumption 



Recently, Chef visited his doctor. The doctor advised Chef to drink at least 

2000

2000 ml of water each day.



Chef drank 

X

X ml of water today. Determine if Chef followed the doctor’s advice or not.



Input Format

The first line contains a single integer 

T

T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

The first and only line of each test case contains one integer 

X

X — the amount of water Chef drank today.

Output Format

For each test case, output YES if Chef followed the doctor’s advice of drinking at least 

2000

2000 ml of water. Otherwise, output NO.



You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

2\. I Can Use Both Hands! 

Chef has a special ability: he can use both his left and right hands equally well, and at the same time!



To put this ability into practice, Chef decides that he’s going to write a novel with his left hand, while writing code with his right.



Chef needs 

L

L minutes to write a page with his left hand, and 

R

R minutes to write a line of code with his right.

Chef defines his satisfaction to be the number of pages he’s started writing, plus the number of lines of code he’s finished writing.



What will Chef’s satisfaction be after 

M

M minutes?



Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer 

T

T, denoting the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case will contain three space-separated integers 

L

,

R

,

L,R, and 

M

M — Chef writing speed, coding speed, and the number of minutes he has.

Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the answer: Chef’s satisfaction after 

M

M minutes.

4.The Old Saint And Three Questions 

Once upon a time, there was a hero and an old saint. And like in any story with a hero and an old saint, the old saint asked the hero — three questions!



But here’s the twist: each question was a binary question, which means that the answer to each must be either a ‘Yes’ or a ‘No’, not none, not both. Our hero, who was not so wise in the ways of science, answered them arbitrarily and just hoped he is correct. The old saint, being so old, does not remember which answers were correct. The only thing that he remembers is - how many of them were ‘Yes’, and how many of them were ‘No’. Our hero will pass the test if the old saint cannot distinguish his responses from the set of correct answers i.e. if the number of ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ in the responses matches that in the correct answers, regardless of their order.



You are given the answers to each of the three questions, and the responses of the hero to the same. Find whether the hero will be able to pass the old saint’s test.



Input Format

First line will contain 

T

T, the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case consists of three space-separated integers

&nbsp;, representing the correct answers to the first, second, and third question respectively (

Output Format

For each test case, print “Pass” (without quotes) if the hero passes the old saint’s test, “Fail” (without quotes) otherwise.
